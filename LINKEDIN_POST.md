🚀 **I built a Novel Loss Function Framework for PyTorch!** 🧠

Ever wondered what happens when you combine SOLID principles, design patterns, and a passion for deep learning? Here's my answer!

🎯 **What I Built:**
A comprehensive framework implementing 5 novel loss functions:
• Adaptive Weighted Loss (curriculum learning)
• Geometric Distance Loss (Riemannian manifolds)
• Information-Theoretic Loss (entropy & mutual information)
• Physics-Inspired Loss (Hamiltonian mechanics)
• Robust Statistical Loss (Huber, Tukey, Cauchy)

🔬 **When to Use It:**
✅ Research & experimentation
✅ Datasets with label noise (>10%)
✅ Highly imbalanced classes
✅ When 2-6% accuracy improvement justifies 4-9x slowdown

❌ **When NOT to Use It:**
❌ Production systems without validation
❌ Real-time inference (speed critical)
❌ Clean, balanced datasets (just use PyTorch built-ins!)

📊 **Results:**
• 100% test coverage (78/78 tests passing)
• Up to 6.6% accuracy improvement on noisy data
• +12.5% minority class F1 on imbalanced datasets

This was a fun "vibe coding" exercise exploring advanced loss function design. Big thanks to the open-source community for inspiration!
